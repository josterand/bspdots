; Polybar can automatically detect the video card (Polybar version 3.7.0 or newer).
; Usually for arch-based system, the main monitor is acpi_video0.
; But if your monitor has a different card name, use 'ls -1 /sys/class/backlight/'
; command and add the value to 'card' variable.

; For security reasons, I turned off the 'scroll to change the brightness value'.
; This requires the polybar to access the file `/sys/class/backlight/${self.card}/brightness`
; which means the polybar needs sudo permissions to write to that file every time you scroll.
